    "TensorFlow primarily relies on two main data structures: tensors and graphs. Let's explore each of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tensor:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** A tensor is a multi-dimensional array or a generalization of a matrix to higher dimensions. It is the fundamental data structure in TensorFlow, representing the input/output of operations and the data flowing between operations in a computational graph.\n",
    "   - **Examples:**\n",
    "     - Scalar (0-D tensor): A single value, e.g., `5`.\n",
    "     - Vector (1-D tensor): An array of values, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`.\n",
    "     - Matrix (2-D tensor): A 2D array, e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`.\n",
    "     - Higher-dimensional tensors: Tensors with more than two dimensions, e.g., a 3D tensor representing a stack of matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Graph:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** In TensorFlow, a graph defines a set of computations as nodes and edges, where nodes represent operations, and edges represent the flow of data (tensors) between operations. The graph is a key component of TensorFlow's computational model, enabling efficient execution and optimization of operations.\n",
    "   - **Examples:**\n",
    "     - Building a graph involves creating nodes for operations and connecting them with tensors. For example, in the following snippet, we create a simple graph with two constants and an addition operation:\n",
    "       ```python\n",
    "       import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "       # Define a graph\n",
    "       a = tf.constant(2)\n",
    "       b = tf.constant(3)\n",
    "       c = tf.add(a, b)\n",
    "\n",
    "       # Execute the graph\n",
    "       with tf.Session() as sess:\n",
    "           result = sess.run(c)\n",
    "           print(result)  # Output: 5\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Variables:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Variables in TensorFlow are used to represent trainable parameters in a model. Unlike constants, their values can be changed during training. Variables are often used to store weights and biases in neural networks.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Define a variable\n",
    "     weight = tf.Variable(initial_value=tf.random.normal(shape=(3, 4)), trainable=True)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Placeholder:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** Placeholders are used to feed actual data into the computational graph during the execution phase. They are typically used for model input, allowing the model to receive different batches of data during training or evaluation.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Define a placeholder\n",
    "     input_data = tf.placeholder(dtype=tf.float32, shape=(None, 10))\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **SparseTensor:**\n",
    "   - **Definition:** SparseTensor is a specialized tensor structure designed for handling sparse data, where most elements are zero. It efficiently represents sparse matrices and is useful in scenarios like natural language processing tasks.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "     # Define a SparseTensor\n",
    "     indices = tf.constant([[0, 0], [1, 2], [2, 1]])\n",
    "     values = tf.constant([1, 2, 3], dtype=tf.float32)\n",
    "     shape = tf.constant([3, 3], dtype=tf.int64)\n",
    "     sparse_tensor = tf.SparseTensor(indices=indices, values=values, dense_shape=shape)\n",
    "     ```\n"

    "In TensorFlow, both constants and variables are used to represent different types of data within a computational graph, but they have key differences in terms of immutability and their role in machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TensorFlow Constant:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutability:** Constants are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are assigned.\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Constants are typically used for values that remain fixed throughout the execution of the graph, such as hyperparameters or values that do not need to be updated during training.\n",
    "- **Creation:** Constants are created using the `tf.constant` operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a TensorFlow constant\n",
    "constant_value = tf.constant(5.0)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### TensorFlow Variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mutability:** Variables are mutable, and their values can be changed during the execution of the graph. They are typically used to represent trainable parameters in machine learning models, such as weights and biases.\n",
    "- **Use Case:** Variables are employed to store values that need to be updated during training to minimize a defined loss function.\n",
    "- **Creation:** Variables are created using the `tf.Variable` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. Matrix Addition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix addition involves adding corresponding elements of two matrices of the same shape. In TensorFlow, this can be done using the `tf.add` operation.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Matrix Multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix multiplication involves multiplying two matrices following the rules of linear algebra. In TensorFlow, matrix multiplication can be performed using the `tf.matmul` operation or the `@` operator.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Element-Wise Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Element-wise operations involve performing operations on corresponding elements of two matrices or a matrix and a scalar. Common element-wise operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations can be performed using standard arithmetic operators or TensorFlow functions.\n",
    "\n",

    "    print(output_elementwise)\n",
    "    # Output: [[2, 4], [6, 8]]\n",
    "```\n",
